  <h1>Refund and Service Issue Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Effective Date: January 29th 2025</em></p>
  
  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    At CentralFloridaAutoCare LLC, we pride ourselves on delivering high-quality detailing services. However, if you experience an issue with our service, please review the following policy to understand your options.
  </p>
  
  <h2>2. Reporting an Issue</h2>
  <p>
    If you are dissatisfied with the service provided, please contact us immediately. You may reach out to our customer support team, or directly contact the detailer or sales representative who facilitated your service. We request that any issues be reported within <strong>7 days</strong> of service completion.
  </p>
  
  <h2>3. Resolution Process</h2>
  <p>
    Upon receiving your report, we will work with you, the detailer, and our sales team to address and resolve the issue. Our primary goal is to ensure your satisfaction, which may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Re-performing the service if feasible, or</li>
    <li>Arranging for repairs at no additional cost to you.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>4. Damage and Liability</h2>
  <p>
    In the event that your issue involves damage to your vehicle or item, and the damage is determined to have been caused by the detailer, the detailer will be responsible for covering the repair costs. To process such claims, we require you to provide documentation (e.g., photographs and repair estimates) that clearly indicate the damage and its extent.
  </p>
  
  <h2>5. Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis after we have reviewed your claim. In many instances, rather than issuing a direct refund, the resolution may involve the detailer covering the repair fees or re-performing the service. We will communicate our decision in writing.
  </p>
  
  <h2>6. Claims and Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    To help us process your claim efficiently, please include the following with your report:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A detailed description of the issue or damage.</li>
    <li>Photographic evidence of the damage.</li>
    <li>Any repair estimates or invoices, if available.</li>
    <li>Your contact information and the date of service.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>7. Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>
    If a resolution cannot be reached with the detailer or the sales representative, please contact our customer support team. We are committed to finding a fair and amicable solution.
  </p>
  
  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to modify this Refund and Service Issue Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on our website and will become effective immediately upon posting.
