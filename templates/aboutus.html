    <h3>From a 13‑Year‑Old Detailer to Founder</h3>
    <p>
      I washed my first car at 13 and reinvested every dollar into my next venture—learning to build websites, market online, and scale small businesses.  
      By 15, I faced homelessness after losing a close friend and watching my family fall apart. A year later, stable housing returned, but so did the frustrations of working for others.  
      Whether excavating supply lines on plumbing jobs or coordinating my mother’s home‑cleaning teams, I saw inefficiencies everywhere—and few tools to solve them.

    <h3>Seeing the Power of Automation</h3>
    <p>
      I realized that when you remove the barriers of awkward human dynamics—power plays, shifting priorities, unpredictable moods—you can focus on delivering amazing service.  
      Inspired by companies like Uber and DoorDash, I set out to build a fully automated ordering and tracking platform—so clients can book details, see progress in real time, and pay seamlessly, without ever picking up the phone.

    <h3>From Trench to Tech</h3>
    <p>
      By 16, I’d traded textbooks for shovels and wrenches—assisting on plumbing jobs while coordinating schedules, ordering materials, and tracking progress across multiple worksites.  
      Whether digging supply lines or organizing crews, I gained firsthand insight into the challenges of managing labor and logistics. That realization inspired me to build a platform where every step—from selecting a wash or detail to tracking completion and handling payments—is automated, transparent, and tailored to both customer and technician.

    <h3>Building the Crew</h3>
    <p>
      I rallied a handful of local teens and we went door‑to‑door offering our cleaning services.
      As word spread, we launched simple social posts to recruit friends who
      shared our commitment to quality. With every new team member, we reinvested in better tools
      and equipment—so our service only got faster, cleaner, and more professional.

    <h3>Our Mission Today</h3>
    <p>
      Central Florida Auto Care was founded on the principle that service should be seamless and dependable.  
      We automate scheduling, payments, and progress tracking so customers and technicians can focus on quality work rather than paperwork.  
      By streamlining every step—from booking to completion—we deliver consistent, exceptional cleaning results and continually refine our process.
